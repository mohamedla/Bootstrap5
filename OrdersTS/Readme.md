# Orders TS
-- Clone Orders but Uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript

This is a web app the run full on the browser <br>
I build this for taking the breakfast  order for me and my colleagues on work cuz it always messy whenever we do it<br>
So i tried to organized it a little and it worked well<br>

### Usage
To but it Simple here you can collect the orders of you and your fellow colleagues <br>
<hr>
- Can add new order row using the "add new order"  button<br>
- Add new food type using the <strong>'+'</strong> icon button <br>
- Remove food type using the <strong>'-'</strong> icon button <br>
- and Cancel an order useng the <strong>'Bin Icon' </strong>button<br>
<hr>
It support both <strong>Arabic</strong> and <strong>English</strong>
<hr>
Can change the food types and names through the <strong>Gear Icon</strong><br>
---- There 2 pages one for client <strong>Names</strong> and the other is for the <strong>Types</strong><br>
- Add new row through the <strong>Add new</strong> on the top<br>
- Remove row type using the <strong>'-'</strong> icon button <br>
- <strong>Edit</strong> the existing data and <strong>Save</strong> the changes by hitting the <strong>Submit</strong> button<br><br>

### The Way it Works


-After choosing the client and start to add type when you enter the quantity of the type it automatically calculate the what the client order cost and the total orders and total orders cost.<br>
-And can check the check box beside the client order cost to mark if he paid it.<br>

-The data you worked on does no go away when you close or refresh the tap.<br>
-The data will be saved on the browser local storage. <br>
-So when the page is opened again it will be the same as when it was close.
